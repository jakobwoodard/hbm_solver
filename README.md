Using pytesseract (Tesseract OCT wrapper) for image processing and pyautogui for controlling clicks on the page.
Seems to only work when using Tesseract 5.0 or >.

# hmb_typing
Solver for Human Benchmark's Verbal Memory test. Inspired by CodeBullet's reaction time solver
Using pytesseract (Tesseract OCT wrapper) for image processing and pyautogui for controlling output.
Will not solve all of HBM's tests, as Tesseract sometimes converts the texts incorrectly. With that being said,
it has a high success rate, but will consistently fail on a few given text prompts.
